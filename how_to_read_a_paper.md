# How to Read a Paper

## Introduction

Learning to efficiently read a paper is a critical but rarely taught skill, this paper describes a simple 'three-pass' approach to efficiently read papers.

## Method

- **The First Pass**
	- Get the general idea of the paper
		1. Read the title, abstract, introduction
		2. Read the section and sub-section headings, but ignore everything else
		3. Read the conclusions
		4. Glance over the references, mentally ticking off the ones youâ€™ve already read.
	- Should be able to answer the 5 Cs after the first pass
		- Catogory, Context, Correctness, Contribution, Clarity
	- May choose to read futher or not after the first pass
	- When writing a paper, you can expect most viewer only make one pass over it

- **The Second Pass**
	- Grasp the paper's content, but not the details
		1. Look at figures, diagrams and other illistrations
		2. Mark relevant unread references for further reading
	- The second pass should take up to an hour
	- Sometimes you won't be able to understand a paper even at the end of the second pass
		- Maybe because the subject matter is new to you
		- Or, the authors may use a proof or experimental technique you don't understand
		- Or, the paper might be poorly written
		- Or, it's just late at night and you're tired
	- You may choose to
		- Set the paper aside and hope that you don't need it to be successful :)
		- Return to the paper later, after getting some rest or after reading some background materials
		- Preserve and go on to the third pass

- **The Third Pass**
	- Understand the paper in depth
	- Attempt to *virtually re-implement* the paper
	- Think about how you yourself would present a particular idea
	- Jot down ideas for future work
	- Could take about 4-5 hours for beginners, and about an hour for experienced reader

## Results

The author used this approch for the last 15 years(2007) to read conference proceedings, write reviews, do background research, and to quickly review a paper before discussion. This disciplined approach prevent from drowning in the details before getting a bird's-eye-view. It allows one to estimate the amount of time required to review a set of papers. Moreover, you can adjust the depth of paper evaluation depending on your own needs and how much time you have.

## Discussion

Great directions for reading a paper, especially for a beginner such as a undergraduate student.
